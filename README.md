Check distribution of `random.choice()` in Python2.7

The distribution of values generated by `random.choice()` is not completely
equal.

This script helps to determine the deviations from strict distributions
experimentally.

It works for Python version 2.7 only! In Python 3.x the problem is fixed.


## background

In fact `random.choice()` picks values by mapping a random number generated
from several bytes to one of the values given in a sequence. But even if these
bytes are completely random, their possible values cannot be distributed
equally over all values of all sequences.

For instance we cannot distribute 256 values (1 byte) over 3-item sequences.
