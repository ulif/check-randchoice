# check-randchoice
Check distribution of `random.choice()` in Python2.7

The distribution of values generated by `random.choice()` is not completely
equal.

This script helps to determine the deviations from strict distributions
experimentally.

## background

In fact `random.choice()` picks values by mapping a random number generated
from several bytes to one of the values given. But even if these bytes are
completely random, their possible values cannot be distributed equally over all
values of all sequences.

For instance we cannot distribute 256 values (1 byte) over 3-item sequences.
